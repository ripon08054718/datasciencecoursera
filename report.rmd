You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
  
  ## Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
  
  ```r
output <- aggregate(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, mean)
output$am <- as.factor(output$am)
levels(output$am) <- c("manual", "automatic")
output
```

```
##          am   mpg
## 1    manual 17.15
## 2 automatic 24.39
```

from the above data we find that the average mileage for automatic is more as compared to that of mileage per galon for a manual transmission car, hence automatic transmission is better as compared to that of manual transmission.
## Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?

```r
library(ggplot2)
output <- mtcars[, c("mpg", "am")]
output$am <- as.factor(output$am)
levels(output$am) <- c("manual", "automatic")
qplot(mpg, data = output, color = am, geom = c("density"), main = "comparison of mileage between automatic and manual transmission")
```

Above figure shows a density plot between the mileage of a manual transmission vs an automatic transmission.
